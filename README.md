# Adaptive Cards Template Service

The Adaptive Cards Template Service is a proof-of-concept service that allows anyone to find, contribute to, and share a broad set card templates. Templates are great if you want to display some data but want to save time by not having to write a custom adaptive card for it.

To learn more about Adaptive Cards visit https://adaptivecards.io

## How does the service help me?

Let's say I just got a piece of data, maybe it's financial data, Microsoft Graph data, schema.org data, or custom data from within my organization. 

Now I want to display the data to a user. 

Traditionally that means writing custom UI code in all of the front-end stacks that I deliver to end-users.

But what if there were a world where my app could "learn" new UI templates based on the type of data? A world where anyone could contribute, enhance, and share common UI templates, within their own projects, within an organization, or for the entire internet.

## What is the card template service?

The card template service is a simple REST endpoint that helps:

* **Find** a template by analyzing the structure of your data
* **Get** a template so you can bind it directly on the client, *without sending your data to the server or ever leaving the device*
* **Populate** a template on the server, when client-side data binding isn't appropriate or possible

Behind it all, is:

* A shared, open-source template repository backed by GitHub. *(The repo is currently private but will be made public as soon as we tie up some loose ends)*
* All the templates are flat JSON files in the repo, which makes editing, contributing, and sharing a natural part of a developer workflow.
* The code for the service will be made available so you can host wherever makes the most sense to you. 

## Using the service

### Get all templates 

This endpoint returns a list of all known templates.

> `HTTP GET https://templates.adaptivecards.io/list`

**Response excerpt**

```json
{
  "graph.microsoft.com": {
    "templates": [
      {
        "file": "Files.json",
        "fullPath": "graph.microsoft.com/Files.json"
      },
      {
        "file": "Profile.json",
        "fullPath": "graph.microsoft.com/Profile.json"
      }
   ]
}
```

### Find a template

You can find templates one of two ways.

The first is by `POST`ing your data to the endpoint, which will analyze the structure of your data and see if any templates can be found.

> `HTTP POST https://templates.adaptivecards.io/find`

The other option is by passing an `odata.type` via query string, for example:

> `HTTP GET https://templates.adaptivecards.io/find?odata.type=%23microsoft.graph.user`

#### Example

Let's say I just hit a [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com) endpoint to get organizational data about me.

> `HTTP GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/`

![Graph Explorer screenshot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/content/2019-08-01-12-08-13.png)

That API returned **JSON data**, but how do I **display it** to users using Adaptive Cards? 

First I want to see if a template exists for this type of data, so I make an HTTP request to the `/find` endpoint with my data in the `POST body`.

```
HTTP POST https://templates.adaptivecards.io/find

{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users/$entity",
    "businessPhones": [
        "+1 412 555 0109"
    ],
    "displayName": "Megan Bowen",
    "givenName": "Megan",
    "jobTitle": "Auditor",
    "mail": "MeganB@M365x214355.onmicrosoft.com",
    "mobilePhone": null,
    "officeLocation": "12/1110",
    "preferredLanguage": "en-US",
    "surname": "Bowen",
    "userPrincipalName": "MeganB@M365x214355.onmicrosoft.com",
    "id": "48d31887-5fad-4d73-a9f5-3c356e68a038"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "templateUrl": "graph.microsoft.com/Profile.json",
    "confidence": 1
  }
]
```

The service returns a list of any matching templates, along with a `confidence` indicating how close the match is. Now I can use that template URL to **get** the template, or **populate** it server-side.

### Get a template

A template retrieved from this endpoint can be populated with data at runtime [using the templatng SDKs](sdk.md).

> `HTTP GET https://templates.adaptivecards.io/[TEMPLATE-PATH]`

You can also include "sample data" with the template, which makes editing in the designer more friendly:

> `HTTP GET https://templates.adaptivecards.io/[TEMPLATE-PATH]?sampleData=true`

#### Example

Let's get the Microsoft Graph profile template that was returned from `/find` above.

`HTTP GET https://templates.adaptivecards.io/graph.microsoft.com/Profile.json`

**Response excerpt**

```json
{
  "type": "AdaptiveCard",
  "version": "1.0",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "size": "Medium",
      "weight": "Bolder",
      "text": "{name}"
    },
    {
        // ...snip
    }
  ]
}
```

Now use this template with the [templating SDKs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/sdk) to create a ready-to-render Adaptive Card.

### Populate a template server-side

In some cases it may not make sense to populate a template on the client.  For these use cases, you can have the service return a fully-populated Adaptive Card, ready to be passed to any Adaptive Card Renderer.

> `HTTP POST https://templates.adaptivecards.io/[TEMPLATE-PATH]`

#### Example

Let's populate the Microsoft Graph profile template that was returned from `/find` using the data above.

```
HTTP POST https://templates.adaptivecards.io/graph.microsoft.com/Profile.json

{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users/$entity",
    "businessPhones": [
        "+1 412 555 0109"
    ],
    "displayName": "Megan Bowen",
    "givenName": "Megan",
    "jobTitle": "Auditor",
    "mail": "MeganB@M365x214355.onmicrosoft.com",
    "mobilePhone": null,
    "officeLocation": "12/1110",
    "preferredLanguage": "en-US",
    "surname": "Bowen",
    "userPrincipalName": "MeganB@M365x214355.onmicrosoft.com",
    "id": "48d31887-5fad-4d73-a9f5-3c356e68a038"
}
```

**Response excerpt**

```json
{
  "type": "AdaptiveCard",
  "version": "1.0",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "size": "Medium",
      "weight": "Bolder",
      "text": "Megan Bowen"
    },
    {
        // ...snip
    }
  ]
}
```

Notice how the response replaced the text of the first `TextBlock` with `"Megan Bowen"` instead of `"{name}"`, as in the `GET` request. This AdaptiveCard can now be passed to any Adaptive Card renderer without going through client-side templating.

## Contributing templates

All templates are stored in this repo, in the `templates` directory. 

Our hope is that by using GitHub as a backing store for the templates, we can "democratize" the process of contributing and sharing templates. Anyone can submit a Pull Request that includes an entirely new template, or make enhancements to existing ones... all within the developer-friendly experience of GitHub.

## Self-hosting the service

We realize that not all types of data are appropriate for the "central" Adaptive Cards template service hosted at `https://templates.adaptivecards.io`. 

The source code for the service is authored as a Azure Function in TypeScript. You can take the code as-is and deploy it to your own Function. 

## Building templating service

### Install Azure Functions Tools 

**On macOS**, install using Homebrew

```console
$ brew tap azure/functions
$ brew install azure-functions-core-tools
```

**On Windows**, install using npm.

```console
$ npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools
```

**On Linux**, follow the instructions in the Azure Functions Core Tools [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools#linux).


### Update `local.settings.json` to point to a Storage account

```json
"AzureWebJobsStorage": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=XXXXXXX;AccountKey=XXXXXXXXXX",
```


The JSON template files get copied from the Git repo into Blob storage and the Function serves them from there.

### Build and run 

```console
cd src
func extensions sync
```

Press `F5` to run
